# World Shaper
- A tool that allows you to create and edit passages for a player to travel through.
- Dependencies: Demigiant: DoTween & Eflatun.SceneReference: git+https://github.com/starikcetin/Eflatun.SceneReference.git#4.1.1

- Editor Set-Up:
	- To use World Shaper, you must first create an area handle. 
		- This scriptable object contains all the information about the area you are creating.
	- You can create an area handle by right-clicking in the project window and selecting Create > World Shaper > New Area Handle.
		- Currently, for the system to work, you must have at least two area handles in the project, and all area handles must have "_Handle" at the end of their names.
		- This is a temporary limitation that will be removed in the future.
	- Once you have created an area handle, you must assign a scene to it. 
		- This is the scene the player will be taken to when they enter the area.
	- Next, you must create a connection. 
		- This sub-asset, scriptable-object, contains all the information about the connection between two areas.
		- You can create a connection by right-clicking on the area handle and selecting Create > World Shaper > New Connection.
		- You can also create a connection by pressing the "Add Connection" button in the Area Handle Inspector.
	- Once you have created a connection, you must assign the connected scene to it. 
		- This is the area the player will be taken to when traveling through the connection.
	- Next, you must choose the passage where the player will exit when they enter the area from the passage dropdown.
		- The connected area handle must have at least one connection for the dropdown to be populated.
	- After you've done that for all the areas you want to connect, we can proceed to the next step.
- Scene Set-Up:
	- World Shaper is dependent on the Transistor script.
		- Transistor is a script that handles the loading and unloading of scenes.
		- You can find a prefab for Transistor in the World Shaper / Resources / Prefabs folder.
		- You must have the Transistor script in your scene for the World Shaper system to work.
	- For each scene you want a passage to connect, you must have game objects with the Passage script attached.
		- The Passage script is a component that contains information about the connection between two areas.
		- There is a prefab for passages that you can find in the World Shaper / Resources / Prefabs folder.
	- Drag the prefab into the scene and position it where you want the player to exit when they enter the area.
	- Assign the connected area handle to the passage and set the end passage to the passage you want the player to come out of after then exit the area.

- Notes:
	- The World Shaper system is designed to be as flexible as possible.
		- You can create as many areas and connections as you want.
		- You can create as many passages as you want in each scene.
		- You can create as many connections as you want between areas.
	- If you wish to load a scene via code, use the ChangeArea method in Transistor.
		- This method takes in the name of the area you want to load (and the passage you want the player to come out of, if you wish).
	- If you wish to reload a scene via code, use the ReloadCurrentArea method in Transistor.
	- The can interact bool on Passages determines if the player can interact with the passage.
		- If true, the player can interact with the passage and travel to the connected area.
		- If false, the player will not be able to interact with the passage.
		- This could be used to create one-way passages with some retooling, but it is not currently supported.
		- Instead, it is used a way to prevent the player from interacting with the immediately after they load into the scene.
